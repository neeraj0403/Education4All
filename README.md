 ## What problem we are trying to solve ? <br/>
 Students in urban areas are blessed with the plenty of resources internet today has to offer. But for a student in the rural areas ,internet connectivity and speed are distant realities. Therefore a solution to provide students in rural areas content and resources for learning through internet is a challenge in itself .A solution based solely on technology , needs infrastructural advancements before even implementing the actual solution.

Hence, we have deduced a solution that incorporates technology (even if the user doesn't have the best quality internet) and solve major problems in rural education , such as LACK OF RESOURCES and LANGUAGE BARRIER faced.


## Our Solution - Education App
AS PER PROBLEM STATEMENT , WE HAVE BUILT A SYSTEM AS FOLLOWS :
Rather than coming up with a platform , we incorporate our solution to the already available Ministry of Education initiative.

Ministry of Education started an initiative in which students pursuing higher education can watch supportive video lectures from professors of reputed universities through specially broadcasted channels.

We take use of this content and propose a solution where with the help of our application , the lectures broadcasted on the TV can be translated to the User's preffered language tat real time and offline.
